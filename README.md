# Introduction
This repository will track my progress of learning Flask to deploy a web backend in Python. Python tests, CI/CD might also be integrated
Future plans include dockerizing or containerizing the application as well.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
This section remains to be updated.
<!-- ```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
``` -->
